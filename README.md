Here’s a simple `README.md` file for your ROS 2 project. It explains the purpose of the project, how to set it up, and how to run it.

# Boundary Avoidance Robot in ROS 2

This ROS 2 project implements a simple boundary avoidance behavior for a robot in a square-shaped environment. The robot moves freely within the boundaries and turns away when it gets close to the edges of the defined area.

---

## **Features**
- Robot moves straight within the field.
- Robot rotates when it gets close to the boundaries (defined thresholds).
- Reactive navigation using `/odom` data.

---

## **Environment Setup**
The robot operates in a square environment:
- Boundaries: `-10 < x < 10` and `-10 < y < 10`
- Thresholds for turning: `-8 < x < 8` and `-8 < y < 8`

## **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/boundary-avoidance-robot.git
   cd boundary-avoidance-robot
   ```

2. **Build the package:**
   ```bash
   colcon build
   ```

3. **Source the workspace:**
   ```bash
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

---

## **Running the Project**

1. **Start Gazebo and RViz:**
   Launch the robot model in the environment using the following command:
   ```bash
   ros2 launch robot_urdf boundary_avoidance.launch.py
   ```

2. **Control the robot:**
   The `boundary_avoidance.py` node will automatically control the robot based on its position in the environment.

---

## **Node Details**
### `boundary_avoidance.py`
- **Purpose:** Ensures the robot avoids boundaries by adjusting its linear and angular velocities.
- **Subscribed Topics:**
  - `/odom`: Reads the robot's current position.
- **Published Topics:**
  - `/cmd_vel`: Sends velocity commands to the robot.

---

## **Simulation Tools**
- **Gazebo**: Simulates the robot and the environment.
- **RViz**: Visualizes the robot's movements and its real-time position.
